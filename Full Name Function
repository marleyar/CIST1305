#Main Function
def main ():
    first = input('Enter your first name, please: ')
    return(first)



#Getting full name
def fullName ():
    first = main()
    last = input('Enter your last name, please: ')
    print(first, last)




#Calling function to print full name
fullName ()

#Note to self: While this code works, it fails Big 0 notation. It would be faster and simpler to have ONE function as opposed to two.
